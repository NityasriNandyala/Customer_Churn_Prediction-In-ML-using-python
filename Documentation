Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning (Python)
🔍 Project Objective
To build a machine learning model that can predict whether a customer will churn (leave the company) or stay, based on historical customer data from a telecom company.

🧠 What is Customer Churn?
Customer churn refers to when a customer stops using a company’s services. Predicting churn helps businesses retain customers, reduce losses, and improve service.

📊 Dataset Features (Example)
The dataset contains information like:
gender: Male/Female
SeniorCitizen: Whether the customer is a senior
Partner / Dependents: Relationship status
tenure: How long they've been a customer
PhoneService / InternetService / Contract
MonthlyCharges / TotalCharges
Churn (Target): Yes/No

🧰 Tools and Technologies Used
Language: Python
Libraries:
pandas, numpy – Data manipulation
scikit-learn – ML modeling
matplotlib, seaborn – Visualization
pickle – Model saving/loading

🛠️ Steps Performed
Data Loading: Loaded customer data using pandas.
Preprocessing:
Handled missing values
Encoded categorical variables
Scaled numeric features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Checked churn distribution
Correlation analysis

Model Training:
Used models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest
Split data using train_test_split

Evaluation:
Used confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall

Model Saving:
Used pickle to save and reload the trained model

🧪 Sample Model Accuracy
Accuracy: ~85% (varies by dataset and preprocessing)

🖥️ Optional Frontend
A simple user interface can be created using:
Streamlit (for live input and prediction)
Flask (for deployment as a web service)

✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to help businesses reduce customer churn by predicting at-risk customers and enabling retention strategies.
